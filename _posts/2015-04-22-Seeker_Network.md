Seeker Networks did a video discussion based on our California Coast couch picture.  There is a little bit of information about the picture itself and our entire West Coast bicyle trip.  They did a great job of collecting and associating the pictures from the trip.  It must have been a lot of work.


More importantly though, are they going to send us a lifetime supply of Michelob Ultra?
