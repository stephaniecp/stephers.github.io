Like I said. I had the great idea to let some of my shit I didn't need for a few weeks, in bushes, quite well hiden... I did let my old Dr.Martens boots and my old foam that looked a bit too homeless, in my backpack, and put my rain cover above the whole thing and then pack up all that in a trash bag.

I though that with the backpack raincover with the trash bag it would be ok... But apparetly it was not. Probably too wet on the "wet" coast, I am not shure.

Whatever, when I went back to get my backpack, it was quite... nasty...

You probably sea green moldy spots before?

Well, the WHOLE this was coevered, and smelled like it... even the booths that were inside. It was bad. I am not talking of the bugs... But I did not care about them, I was just concern for the serious moldy shit all over.

I though it was sad because it's good shit and I would have to trow away all that stuff...

I packed that up back in a trash bag, bungee-corded to my bike and got to Vancouver to meet with Jon before figuring that out. Then I tried to give it a wash, in a city fountain there, with soap and everything...

Still NASTY...

Then I tried to take the frame out, put it in a front load machine in a laundromat... with some bleach...

Miracle!

It worked! (For the backpack). The boots and foam made a long trip to the dump, but its okay they were very old and beated-up).

Still not worth to do it again though...
