Like I said. I had the great idea to leave some of my shit I didn't need for a few weeks, in bushes, quite well hidden... I left my old Dr. Martens boots and my old foam that looked a bit too homeless and my backpack, and put my rain cover above the whole thing and then packed up all of that in a trash bag.

I thought that with the backpack raincover and the trash bag it would be ok... But apparetly it was not. Probably too wet on the "wet" coast, I am not sure.  

Whatever, when I went back to get my backpack, it was quite... nasty...

You've probably seen green moldy spots before?

Well, the WHOLE backpack was covered in mold, and smelled like it... even the boots that were inside. It was bad. I am not talking about the bugs... I did not care about them, I was just concerned for the serious moldy shit all over.

I thought it was sad, because it was good shit and I would have to throw away all that stuff...

I packed them up in a trash bag, bungee-corded to my bike and got to Vancouver to meet with Jon before figuring that out. Then I tried to give it a wash, in a city fountain there, with soap and everything...

Still NASTY...

Then I tried to take the frame out, put it in a front load machine in a laundromat... with some bleach...

Miracle!

It worked! (For the backpack). The boots and foam made a long trip to the dump, but its okay they were very old and beaten-up).

Still not worth doing it again though...
