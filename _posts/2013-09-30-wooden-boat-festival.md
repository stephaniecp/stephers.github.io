We ended up as volunteers for this crazy awesome <a href="http://woodenboat.org/festival/">boat festival</a> in this sweet little town, Port Townsend in Washington state. What we ended up doing for our work was mainly "greeting" (a nice way to say bouncer, checking if people have their pass and gently kicking them out if they don't) and also cleaning up the ground, taking out the trash when the trash cans get filled up. Playing with trash was a very fun part! But here isn't the point, volunteering was a great way to get in for "free", the best part was on the other side of the gate. 

We got to see so many crazyyyy boats and get in some of them. My favorite, was a small <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/porttownsendbob/sets/72157633952804764/with/8999640215/">Scamp named Peanut</a>, very cute little boat. It was quite interesting to see all these beautiful floating devices and people putting that much love into them. Love that I think, is quite similar to the love we put in our bicycles... Well the love I give to Jenny at least. I have never owned a boat and do not have very much skills in that sort of thing (yet) I can kayak, but even on a rowboat, I am pretty pathetic... But it's okay, I have fun and that is all that really matters!
 
Anyways, it was beautiful. We got to see tons of very sexy boats! We also got to have some great american junk food, live music, fun, and more fun :)

And... the whole thing closed with an awesome dinner for the volunteers on the 8th, which was also my birthday, apparently the whole planet didn't know about it, but Jon made sure that all Port Townsend knew about it.
