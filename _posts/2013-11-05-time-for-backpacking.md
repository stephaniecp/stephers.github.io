So to make this short, Jon and I both wanted, for different reasons (not that exciting to go in details) to get our butts East sometime in the fall before the cold. Jon in his hometown in Connecticut (USA) and me in mine, in Quebec City (Canada). I then offered to Jon to hitchhike all the way across Canada (having done it before, 3 times, it's a lot of fun, mind blowing sometimes, georgeous... free... and also a lot faster than bicycle). Jon, hadn't seen all that much of Canada before (beside Toronto, Montreal where he would go drink before he turned 21, and this summer around BC) was pretty stoked by the proposition and totally accepted to adventure the shit out of Canada with me, backpacking/hitching this time.

Now, in order to make it East in time (and counting a bit more time to stop in all the spots I though were worth it) we had to get the hell out of Port Townsend (WA), by the end of September. 

That's what we did.

Jon left Clyde (his bicycle) in good hands in Port Townsend and filled up his old backpack. He made it to Vancouver (BC) by ferries, thumb and bus for the border. 

I did it differently since I needed to go get my backpack/old beated-up boots in some bushes on Vancouver Island (I left them before going to the US, too beaten-up to look like a yuppie tourist) about 3 weeks before.

So I went on Van Island like I planned to, on my bike and met with Jon again in Vancouver the next day.

We both made it. But before we left, we wanted: riding more bikes in Vancouver AND getting fat on sushis in an all you can eat, that we have been dreaming of all summer, while riding our bikes. However, Jon was bikeless at that point... But luckily, Lindsay, our awesome friend, bicycle wingnut, that we were also staying with in Vancouver, and that was going to host Jeennifer (my bike) for the time I leave, did let Jon ride her awesome tricycle (with a funny ski helmelt with flowers on it I must add). He did look ridiculous as sh*t, but like we then realized... shit bikes are better than no bike. (No offence Lindsay, I love your tricycle :) I would just not tour too far with it... hehe). We then went for a few bike rides, rided with the Vancouver bicycle society again (where it all started for me) and we finnaly, was a lot of fun, and then, after a whole summer of dreaming of it, got fat on sushis!!!

 

Then, the sad part of unloading Jenny and packing up my backpack came. I did it. Actually, it was a different excitement. Not bicycling anymore and kinda nostalgic in a way, but we were going to have some crazy adventures again!

 

After that, and only after that, we were ready to: ADVENTURE THE SHIT OUT OF CANADA!
