A few weeks ago, Jon and I were walking down some beach in Tofino (BC), Jon spotted some nice salal berry bushes. He then thought, "wait, why don't we ever see salal berry jelly anywhere, the berries are free and everywhere on the coast...". Excellent question, "so why don't we start making this jelly? it should be very easy, just heat up the berries somehow, add sugar... and that's about it", you can add pectin kinda stuff to make it take more of a jelly texture, but that isn't necessary to work.

That was the beginning of a lot of jelly making experiments... salal, thimble, salmon berries, plums, black berries... 

Here are some pictures of making salal berry jelly, road style, on our last experiment, here on North Pender island, BC.

###Glad to try our first jelly with pectin (should make it take more of a jelly texture)###
