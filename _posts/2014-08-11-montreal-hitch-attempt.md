Hitchhiking is an adventurous act of trust and powerful social therapy.  I arrived in Montreal this morning by bus and thought I would try my luck to get to Québec City by hitchhiking.  It has been a while since I last hitchhiked with Steph and I have only tried it alone once a long time ago.  As I stood there with my sign and bag, I went through a range of feelings.  First, it seemed like everyone going by was dressed for the office.  A lot of these people averted their eyes or seemed to look condescendingly. At least that’s how I imagined it as they roared by.  It’s been long enough since I hitchhiked that I had lost the feel of what it is like and who stops.  When seeing the office types racing by, I had a feeling like I was begging, which is absolutely not what I’m doing.  After a little while, I had two cars in quick succession that rolled down windows and said “bonjour” and something else positive that I couldn’t make out.  Hitchhiking is an invitation to hang out and share a ride and these people reminded me of that feeling.  Hitchhiking is a way to battle the modern social isolation, one interaction at a time.

I remember talking about hitchhiking with a friend a while back.  She said that she finds it creepy when hitchhikers make eye contact with the drivers going by.  I think it’s sad that the simplest possible act of sincerity, eye contact, is considered creepy.   Over a good number of rides it feels like the generosity of drivers is proportional to the happiness that you show.  After a few of the grumblers goes by it becomes hard to have a positive outlook and project the smile that will get you the next ride.  It’s a strong reminder of the old saying, “smile and the world smiles with you”.  We all need to be reminded of this as often as possible.

It took somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 or so rides to cross Canada last summer.  In all of those rides, the only thing in common was a willingness to interact with a fellow human across whatever gap might exist.  We were picked up by wealthy people, poor people, trucks, new cars, old cars, minivans, hunters, oil field workers, mothers, first people, last people, musicians, professionals, fruit pickers and at least one company exec.  The interactions were all interesting and all good.  

I think we should battle paranoia where we can.  Spreading generosity and kindness is worth the challenge.

Oh, by the way, I gave up and took the bus today. :)
