One of the most surprising and amazing things about traveling by bike has been experiencing the kindness of strangers.  Even in a friendly place like Portland, Oregon in a normal day to day life it can be rare to experience sincere generosity from somebody unfamiliar to me.  I think even in the presence of generous people if you are in your normal daily routine, the opportunities for interaction, for giving and receiving generosity are more limited than when you are traveling.

My first experiences with this happened earlier in my trip when I was heading North in Oregon and I started encountering bicycle tourers headed south.  From enthusiastic waves to people flagging me down, the encounters rarely went unacknowledged.  Imagine if this were the case while driving in a car, you'd never be able to get anywhere.  On a bike though, each traveler you encounter might have some valuable info about where you should stay that night and you likely have some important information for them.  It's not just trivial information.  Traveling by bike (or by backpack) means that you have left yourself more open and more vulnerable to the world.  Being aware of your surroundings and your own resources suddenly takes on greater importance.  For me, this has meant that my experience of every day has become more vivid.  There are a lot of signs that my subconscious is taking the whole experience more seriously too and I am having more elaborate dreams at night.

For people that are not familiar with the amazing generosity in traveling communities, I'd recommend checking out warmshowers.org and couchsurfing.com.  These websites are really just the tip of the iceberg, but if you want to see the potential for connection amongst travelers, they are a good start.  In Washington, in the first few days of my trip I was welcomed into a bike touring family's house for a dinner feast and warm room.  It was really an unfamiliar experience for me, but it has been repeated many times over the last few months.  These experiences have really raised the bar in my optimism towards interactions with people.  Because of this, I find myself being warmer to the people I encounter and in turn, the interactions with people have gotten better.

Steph has countless stories about the generosity that she has experience while traveling over the last couple of years.  It seems that many people want to share in her adventure, possibly to continue the kindness they once experienced during traveling or to momentarily share in her adventure.  Steph talked about a woman coming up to Steph and her companions simply saying, "what do you need?!" or people offering food while she was having coffee outside McDonald's.  

It's interesting experiencing how the kindnesses and adventures on the road build on each other and link to one another.  A few days ago, Steph's brake cable snapped on North Pender Island.  We found a small store with wifi and our first searches for a bike shop returned nothing for the island.  With the bikes fully loaded, riding on one brake is pretty dangerous.  It seemed like our time on the Pender Islands might be over.  I asked the girl working at the store about a bike shop and she said somebody had recently started a part time bike shop that was part of the local recycling center.  She gave me a number for the person she knew.  The next morning we were at the Pender Island Recycling Center and talking to Richard who was one of the organizers for the shop.  He said the person who does the repair work may or may not be coming in that day, but we could leave the bike and come back later.  We left a note to rerun both of Steph's brakes and we also asked about used front panniers which Steph had been looking for.  They didn't have any.  In a few hours we returned and the bike was all fixed up for a very reasonable fee.  We talked with Richard some more and he told us a bit about his bike touring in New Zealand and Hawaii.  His travels sounded like a lot of fun.  He said he would bring his panniers in the next morning and Steph could take a look and see if she wanted to buy them.  When we stopped by the next morning, Richard brought out a beautiful set of old front panniers that were a perfect fit for the old racks on the front of Steph's bike!  He said they were a gift and asked that Steph pass them on to another cycle tourer in need when she is done with them.  Thanks Richard!  One more amazing act of kindness on the road.
