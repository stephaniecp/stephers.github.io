		<dd>Up tight person (that doesn't poop) that works in a cubicule too many hours a week and would rather go to the gym to train instead of walking to work. Yuppies shops at Abercrombie and Fitch, and all that stuff, and like to drink Starbucks coffee (in a reusable cup) because McDonald's coffee is gross. They shower everyday and hate the smell of humans. They always think they are fat and are always on some new revolutionary diet to lose weight. They drive around in their Suburban of the year. Once a year, they take a week of vacation off to some yuppie resort in Mexico, where they never forget to take a whole bunch of pictures to put on their facebook and pin into their cubicle's walls. They use Purell many times a day because they are very scared of germs.</dd>
