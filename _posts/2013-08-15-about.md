We would like to open by saying we are 100% open to sponsorship.  Companies that might want to consider an ad on our top tubes, wheel rim walls or panniers might include McDonalds, Walmart, Kraft (or any peanut butter company really), Tim Hortons, Starbucks, MEC, REI, Deep Woods Off, Hennessy Hammocks, TriFlow Lubricant, Mr. Noodles Ramen, Ortlieb, Brooks' Saddles, Raleigh Bicycles, Canon Cameras and NOT Axiom Performance Gear .

We are two dirty hippies (well we are not fucking hippies, but it might be the closest term to describe us for most people) wingnuts on bicycles traveling around the Pacific Northwest (so far). Our plan is to adventure the shit out of this planet.

<span class="big-start">Steph</span> is a long time backpacker and an expert at living free.  She met two cycle tourers, Jon and <a href="http://wandermu.de/">Carl</a> in Vancouver BC and was convinced to get a bicycle at 2AM after three days of riding with <a href="http://vancouvercm.blogspot.ca/">Critical Mass</a>, Bicycle Society and a <a href="http://bikerave.ca/">Bike Rave</a>.  Steph has backpacked all over Canada and the Western US.  She writes songs about traveling and plays on Little Debbie, an awesome guitarlele.  She is a blackbelt dumpster diver.  She currently resides in North... wherever she pleases.

<span class="big-start">Jon</span> is a funny and very friendly character, he is very much into bicycles and foraging awesome free nice organic food straight from the woods, ocean, sides of roads... He is also working on becoming an awesome urban forager (dumpster diving, picking up leftovers from trash cans, etc) since he got his mind blown after his first nice big find of doughnuts in some dumpster in Vancouver BC. He has amazing skills in building or fixing stuff out of pieces of junk, but also with the people. His positive attitude towards everything makes everything seem so possible! Oh... and also he is the geek that made this blog possible... He doesn't carry very much in his panniers, but he does bike around with a laptop... and a hacky sack!
